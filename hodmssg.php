						Welcome to the department of Electronics & Communication Engineering at Indian Institute
						of Information Technology, Allahabad. The department was established in the year 2006
						with the aims of providing leadership in the field of Electronics & Communication Engineering
						and pioneering interdisciplinary research with Information Technology. We strive to train and
						empower our students who will make the world a better place by using power of engineering
						principles, techniques and systems. To that end, considerable initiative have been taken 
						to establish state of the art research laboratories in the area of VLSI design and 
						technology, MEMS and sensors, embedded systems, wireless and optical communication, 
						cognitive radios, MIMO technologies, RF and microwave engineering. Additionally, being 
						a center of excellence in Information Technology, the institute provides greater exposure
						of core areas of Information Technology to the students of ECE department at IIITA as
						compared to the students registered in similar program at other premier institutes of 
						India. Students are encouraged to undertake project in a group starting from Vth semester
						and advance research project in VIIIth semester under the able guidance of faculties in 
						these emerging areas. Opportunity for innovation and incubation is provided at this stage
						to successful projects by the institute for industrial standards. The department offers 
						financial support to its young faculty for cutting edge research and also encourages them
						to undertake sponsored research from industry and government agencies. Presently several 
						project sponsored by DST, DeitY are under way in the department. Also department provide
						healthy environment to students and faculties to carry out inter department collaborative
						research in area like bio medical engineering, robotics, human computer interface etc. 
						Having undergone such a robust academic programme under the supervision of highest 
						quality faculty members, I am sure that all passing out students of the department are 
						capable of visualizing, planning and developing big projects of commercial and research
						interests in their respective field of expertise. Thus, I would like to invite the 
						Industries, Companies, PSUs and other organizations for conducting the recruitment 
						activities @IIITA. Also, the invitation is open for the potential candidates to join 
						the institute as faculty member and strengthen the academic and research activities of
						the department.<br><br>
